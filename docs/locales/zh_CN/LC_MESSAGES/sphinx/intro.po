msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:97
msgid ""
"The most important functionality available with MyST markdown is writing "
"**directives**. Directives are kind-of like functions that are designed "
"for writing content. Sphinx and reStructuredText use directives "
"extensively. Here's how a directive looks in MyST markdown:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:125
msgid ""
"For those who are familiar with reStructuredText, you can find [a mapping"
" from MyST directive syntax to rST syntax here](syntax/directives)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:128
msgid ""
"As seen above, there are four main parts to consider when writing "
"directives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:130
msgid ""
"**the directive name** is kind of like the function name. Different names"
" trigger different functionality. They are wrapped in `{}` brackets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:132
msgid ""
"**directive arguments** come just after the directive name. They can be "
"used to trigger behavior in the directive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:134
msgid ""
"**directive options** come just after the first line of the directive. "
"They also control behavior of the directive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:136
msgid ""
"**directive content** is markdown that you put inside the directive. The "
"directive often displays the content in a special way."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:139
msgid ""
"For example, add an **`admonition`** directive to your markdown page, "
"like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:154
msgid ""
"Re-build your Sphinx site and you should see the new admonition box show "
"up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:156
msgid ""
"As you can see, we've used each of the four pieces described above to "
"configure this directive. Here's how the directive looks when rendered:"

"For more information about using directives with MyST, see "

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:170
msgid "Reference a section label with a role"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:172
msgid ""
"Roles are another core Sphinx tool. They behave similarly to directives, "
"but are given in-line with text instead of in a separate block. They have"
" the following form:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:179
msgid ""
"Roles are a bit more simple than directives, though some roles allow for "
"more complex syntax inside their content area. For example, the `ref` "
"role is used to make references to other sections of your documentation, "
"and allows you to specify the displayed text as well as the reference "
"itself within the role:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:186
msgid ""
"For example, let's add a **section reference** to your markdown file. To "
"do this, we'll first need to add a **label** to a section of your page. "
"To do so, use the following structure:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:195 ../../sphinx/intro.md:223
msgid "Add this to your markdown file from above, like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:214

"Because your new section has a label (`section-two`), you can reference "
"it with the `ref` role. Add it to your markdown file like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:245
msgid ""
"Re-build your documentation and you should see the references "
"automatically inserted. Here's an example of how the `ref` roles look in "
"the final output:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:256
msgid ""
"There are many other kinds of syntax in MyST to make writing more "
"productive and enjoyable. Let's play around with a couple of options."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:259
msgid ""
"First, try writing a **comment**. This can be done by adding a line "
"starting with `%` to your markdown file. For example, try adding a "
"comment to your markdown file, like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:284
msgid ""
"Re-build your documentation - the comment should _not_ be present in the "
"output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:286
msgid "Extending MyST via configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:288
msgid ""
"Thus far we have covered the basic MyST syntax with Sphinx. However, "
"there are a few ways that you can _extend_ this base syntax and get new "
"functionality. The first is to enable some \"out of the box\" extensions "
"with the MyST parser. These add new syntax that aren't part of \"core "
"MyST\" but that are useful nonetheless (and may become part of core MyST "
"one day)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:293
msgid ""
"Let's extend the base MyST syntax to enable **fences for directives**. "
"This allows you to define a directive with `:::` in addition to ` ``` `. "
"This is useful for directives that have markdown in their content. By "
"using `:::`, a non-MyST markdown renderer will still be able to render "
"what is inside (instead of displaying it as a code block)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:298
msgid ""
"To activate extensions, add a list to your `conf.py` file that contains "
"the extensions you'd like to activate. For example, to activate the "
"\"colon code fences\" extension, add the following to your `conf.py` "
"file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:307
msgid ""
"You may now use `:::` to define directives. For example, modify your "
"markdown file like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:335
msgid ""
"It should render as a \"note block\" in your output when you build your "
"site."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:337
msgid "Install a new Sphinx extension and use its functionality"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:339
msgid ""
"The other way to extend MyST in Sphinx is to install Sphinx extensions "
"that define new directives. Directives are kind of like \"functions\" in "
"Sphinx, and installing a new package can add new directives to use in "
"your content."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:342
msgid ""
"For example, let's install the `sphinxcontib.mermaid` extension, which "
"will allow us to generate [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid-"
"js.github.io/mermaid/#/) with MyST."
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:344
msgid "First, install `sphinxcontrib.mermaid`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:350
msgid "Next, add it to your list of extensions in `conf.py`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:359
msgid "Now, add a **mermaid directive** to your markdown file. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:403
msgid "When you build your documentation, you should see something like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:419
msgid "Next steps - Learn more about MyST Syntax"

#: ../../sphinx/intro.md:421
msgid ""
"In this tutorial we've covered some of the basics of MyST Markdown, how "
"to enable and use it with Sphinx, and how to extend it for new use-cases."
" There is much more functionality in MyST (and in the Sphinx ecosystem) "
"that we haven't covered here. For more information, see the "
