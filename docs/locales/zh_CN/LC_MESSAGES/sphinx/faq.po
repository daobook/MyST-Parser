"There are some roles/directives that _hard-code_ syntax into their "
"behavior. For example, many roles allow you to supply titles for links "
"like so: `` {role}`My title <myref>` ``. While this looks like "
"reStructuredText, the role may be explicitly expecting the `My title "
"<myref>` structure, and so MyST will behave the same way."
